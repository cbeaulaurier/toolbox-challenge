        <h1>How to Play Memory</h1>
        <p>Memory (also called Concentration) is played by flipping over two tiles at a time.
        If they match, the tiles stay face-up. If they don't match, they both get
        flipped back over. The object of the game is to get all the pairs of tiles matched.
        It's a test of your memory!</p>
